### Project description

A crafting/rhythm game where you compose your own music and go beat monsters to its beat.\
This game was created in 17 days during the game jam [Summer Slow Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/ssjcrafting)

In this project I participated as a lead programmer, coordinating team members and developing core game mechanics, including a minimalistic digital audio workstation and a rhythm game component.\
Character and enemy controllers, combat mechanics were done by [Gribiwe](https://github.com/Gribiwe)\
Music, menus were done by [Apxthem](https://github.com/Apxthem)\
Sprites, animations and level design were done by [tenori-nori](https://github.com/tenori-nori)
