### Project description

A crafting/rhythm game where you compose your own music and go beat monsters to its beat.\
This game was created in 17 days during the game jam [Summer Slow Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/ssjcrafting)

I participated as a lead programmer in the development of this game.\
I coordinated team members and developed the core game mechanics, including a minimalistic digital audio workstation and a rhythm game component.

Here is the gameplay video:\
